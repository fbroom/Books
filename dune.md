* The man is Stilger and he is a Fremen leader. He explains the customs and traditions of the crysknife
* Stilger and the Duke agree that Duncan will now be a Fremen, more like an ambassador to connect the two families. Duncan keeps the knife. The harkonnens have just announce a high prize for whoever brings a crysknife
* After Stilger left, the Duke asks Duncan about getting at least two battalions of the Fremen to help against the Sardaukar

* Kynes tells them about the worms and how there are worms wherever there is spice. The Dukes asks about how to avoid them or kill them. Kynes tells him the only way it works is by electrifying them.

* The Duke excuses himself to go oversee an urgent matter and asks Paul to take over.
