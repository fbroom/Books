Book: Solaris

Chapter 1:
Kris Kelvin a psychologist traveling from Prometheus to a station above the planet Solaris. When he arrives though, he finds the station empty. He finally sees Snaut and asks him about Gibarian who is supposedly waiting for Kelvin. Snaut is acting weird and seems to be confused. Kelvin insists on knowing what happened to Gibarian and finally Snaut tells him that Gibarian died that morning. He also tells him to go upstairs and meet with Sartorius in an hour. He warns Kelvin that he might be seeing things and to just be careful. Snaut had even blood on his knuckles. 


Chapter 2:
Kelvin goes to the only room not occupied by the other two scientists. He showers and changes. He finds a history book on Solaris and starts reading it. The history of Solaris starts about a 100 years before Kelvin was born. The next several pages are about the history of Solaris that started a 100 years ago.

 It started from simply monitoring the planet Solaris’s orbit and realizing that its orbit is unstable. After sending a crew over to Solaris, their results were divided. The biologists thought the ocean in Solaris is some organic big cell that extended over all the ocean while the physicists thought the ocean possessed some intelligent life that was able to alter its own orbit and not just some blob.

The debate continued and more research was done. Stimuli was inserted into the ocean to study it further but there was still no conclusion. Some thought the ocean was a huge brain more advanced than the human brain by millions of year and that we humans just couldn’t and wouldn’t be able to understand it and some thought it wasn’t because when one of the missions dropped into the ocean and caused a huge 1 mile-wide damage, it didn’t seem to affect anything. Some thought the funding for the project Solaris should be cut. Kelvin overall thought that all this research is BS and that we still know nothing and at square zero pretty much.

While Kelvin was reading, he suddenly felt paralyzed and that someone were watching him. He tried to move and the movement freed him. But he suddenly saw the room empty. He suddenly understood why Snaut might be paranoid. He just experienced paranoia. 

He decides to take a peek into Gibarian’s room. He finds notes. He starts reading to discover that Gibarian was running experiments such as subjecting the ocean to radiation for days which shocks Kelvin since any use of X-rays had been banned. While he’s browsing the notes, someone comes knocking on the door but Kelvin holds the door until they finally left. 


Chapter 3:
Kelvin collects Gibarian’s notes into his pocket. He notices a note on the floor addressing him. There are references to a certain book so needs to go the library to find out more. He also notices a tape recorder and collects that into his pocket. He left the room and noticed a naked black woman in the hallway. She was only wearing a yellow skirt. She walked without even looking at Kelvin into Gibarian’s room and closed the door. Kelvin was dripping with sweat. He went to meet Snaut and tried to get information on the radiation that he read about. Snaut was shocked that Kelvin knew about this. Kelvin learns that it was Snaut who was trying to open Gibarian’s room. Snaut also tells him that he found Gibarian’s dead in the closet in his room in that same morning. Kelvin also told Snaut about the woman and tried to question Snaut about her. Snaut though freaked out on Kelvin and wouldn’t say anything. Kelvin eventually decides to collect gas pistols and leave the room. 


Chapter 4:
Kelvin finds the books in Gibarian’s room. He sees a bookmark around the name Andre Berton. He flips the pages and eventually finds the details surrounding what happened to Andre during an expedition to Solaris. Two scientists have been gone missing and crews were sent to search for them. One scientist was found and the other was gone eventually. Andre came after sunset to the station. He wasn’t okay. He insisted on writing a report about what happened. But that report was eventually filed in his medical report after he broke down. People thought the ocean poisoned him. Kelvin then decides that he needs a break from the book and goes to Sartorious’s lab. He keeps knocking and threatening Sartorius to open the door but Sartorius wouldn’t. He eventually peeks out of the door but tells Kelvin that he absolutely could not come in. After they talk for just a little bit, Sartorius then begs Kelvin to leave as voices start to come from inside the lab. Kelvin tries to find out what’s happening by going around the lab. He saw everything glowing in the lab like crazy. He ran downstairs and Snaut again. Snaut again wouldn’t tell him anything. He did say to Kelvin that he’ll understand once Kelvin gets his own “visitors”. Kelvin goes to the storage room after that and finds Gibarian’s body next the black woman’s body. He thinks he’s going mad and goes upstairs again. He decides that he needs to perform some kind of experiment to prove that he is not hallucinating. 


Chapter 5:
Kelvin goes to his room. He falls asleep and wakes up to Harey sitting across from him. She still looks like her 19-year old self although she’s supposed to be 29 but the dead will always be young. He wishes she vanishes but she was still there when he opened his eyes again for the second time. She was a girlfriend who committed suicide after an argument with Kelvin. Kelvin wishes he could take those words aways that he had said but of course he can’t. He knows she can’t be real. He tries to question her but she seemed to really be confused and out of it. She also mentions that he looks like Pelvis, a person she could not have met since Kelvin met Pelvis 3 years after her death. Kelvin tries to leave her in the room but she insists on following him around. He gets anxious. He then tries to put a flying suit on her but the dress’s buttons are all decorative (so weird). He rips it off and puts the suit on her. They finally leave the room and go to the docking bay. He locks her in the space shuttle. He starts hearing inhumane grunts. He freaks out and works on sending the space shuttle into space. He doesn’t turn the monitor on to see what’s going on and leaves the room. 


Chapter 6:
Kelvin goes back to his room only to find Snaut waiting for him. Snaut asks if he finally got visitors and Kelvin tells him yes. Kelvin demands more information now that he’s in the same club as the rest. Snaut tells him that Gibarian was the first one to get visitors and that they couldn’t save him. He also tells him that Harey will come back and won’t remember anything. They always come back! When Snaut leaves, he hands Kelvin Gibarian’s book that Kelvin wanted to read. The books details Andre Berton’s testimony. Berton claims that while flying over the ocean in the fog, he saw a huge garden right in there. The garden broke down and he saw a wall at the bottom of the ocean with lots of windows with lots of movements coming from these windows. He then saw a child appearing even though his movements were mechanical and not really believable. The child was also huge. The committee obviously doesn’t take Berton’s testimony seriously and closes the case. Only one person in the committee believes Berton. He pleaded to listen to Berton but they wouldn’t give him a chance. 


Chapter 7:
She is back and watching him sleep. He slept for a long time. After he wakes up. He tries to lock her up but she goes insane and comes back all injured in blood and confused because she doesn’t know why she did this exactly. They go downstairs to eat and then they head to the lab where Kelvin tells her that will her examine her. He takes a blood drop from her and tries to examine using the microscope but he is unable to see anything with details. He then has a conference calls with both Snaut and Sartorious to talk about the G-formations (aka visitors / ghosts). They share what they each think. For example that the g-formations are formed from their most intense memory. The memory is copied along with some of the present memories which explains why Harey would know about Pelvis even though she couldn’t. They also talk about what the blood is made of. One theory was it was made of neutrinos. 


Chapter 8: Monsters
Kelvin and Harey go to bed but Kelvin wakes up on the sound of Harey getting upset and crying because she thinks he doesn’t love her. He comforts her and she tells him that she loves him. Sartorious wants some of Harey’s blood/plasma to test it. He heads to the library to study neutrinos. Here, Kelvin reads on and on about Giese who is a scientistic who classified the ocean creatures? Cells? Parts? There is so much in this chapter about mimiods, symmertriads, antisymmteriads. Prepare to have a headache or extreme fatigue reading this chapter. Fuck. Kelvin though eventually decides to maybe delay giving Sartorius the sample he wants because he now wants to save Harey? So he goes back to study neutrinos trying to figure out the math behind it? Snaut comes knocking the door. Kelvin finally introduces him to Harey as his wife!! Snaut speaks privately to Kelvin about being afraid of what Sartorius is planning to do. He’s planning on more dangerous stuff. Sartorious wants to use brain waves (waking states) in the rays to the ocean. Snaut is happy that Kevin agrees with him on the fact that Sartorius is wrong. He then tells Kelvin about another project an “annihilator”, A neutrino field that Sartorius plans to use. Kelvin gets scared and shows Snaut the formulas that proves that this device will destroy again. Kelvin doesn’t want to die like this. 


Chapter 9: Liquid Oxygen
Gibarian shows up to Kelvin in his room and warns him about Snaut and Sartorious. They are teaming up against Kelvin. He asks Gibarian about Harey. He is worried about her. He then wakes up to find her next to him and the tape recorder missing from under the bed. Throughout the day, he notices that Harey has been more lost in thought than her usual. When they go to bed, he wakes up again to find that Harey had ingested liquid oxygen and is burning. Kelvin is screaming for Harey and the experience is awful but she doesn’t die at the end and slowly recovers to her normal self. Harey finally tells him that she figured out who she is. From observing his conversation with Sanut in the library and from Gibarian’s tape. She tells him that she knows it’s not her. 


Chapter 10: Conversation
Kelvin goes to talk to Snaut about how Harey knows everything. Snaut just dismisses it like it’s not important. Kelvin tells him he wants to take her out and Snaut laughs at him. Snaut tells Kelvin that he must be insane because no ones knows what would happen to “them” since they were made of this neutrino field. She might simply blow up. He tells Kelvin to go get the space shuttle that he sent in the orbit with the first version of Harey to see what actually happened to her. Kelvin doesn’t want to do it. Snaut tells kelvin to show up to the experiment tomorrow morning where they’re extract the brain waves from Kelvin to send it to the ocean. Kelvin says yes but he is having second thoughts about the experiment. 


Chapter 11: The Thinkers
Kelvin meets Snaut and Sartorious to start the experiment. They extract his brain waves. After the experiment, he goes to the library with Harey. He finds an old book on the old research about Solaris. Some more history about the Solaris debate. Some more books that claim that Solaris is just another religion for those who believe there is life there. I don’t have much notes here. Kelvin talks about his time with Gibarian and also his thesis. 


Chapter 12: The Dreams
Nothing happens after the experiment. They continue to repeat it without results. Kelvin starts to have really bad dreams. Kelvin is also worried about Snaut and Sartorious working on the annihilator but there isn’t an evidence toward that. Days after that, the ocean starts to respond with some huge things/waves coming out from it. 


Chapter 13: Victory
Some more time with nothing happening since the incident with the ocean. During one night, Kelvin wakes up to Harey talking to someone in the hallway. He gets scared and finds himself unable to comfort Harey about it when she returned. The next night Kelvin tells Harey about when they’ll go back together to Earth but Harey doesn’t won’t to hear it. She asks him though to marry someone but Kelvin tells her that he loves her and wouldn’t do that. Harey gives him some juice that he takes before bed. It put Kelvin to sleep. The next morning, Kelvin realizes that Harey was gone and Snaut tells him that she is dead. He is mad. He starts yelling and screaming. Snaut tells him that she won’t be back. Since that night with the ocean got all crazy. She leaves him a letter telling him that it was her choice and that she’s sorry. 


Chapter 14: The Old Memoid
Discussion about an imperfect God between Kelvin and Snaut. Kelvin goes on a trip over the ocean. Snaut thought Kelvin is losing it and might intend to kill himself or something but Kelvin says he just wants to experience Solaris. He is marveled at the ocean and thinks about Harey.
