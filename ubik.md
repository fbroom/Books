Psi: (Talents) (Hollis)
Telepath: can read your thoughts
Precog: they can foresee the future but they can’t change anything

Anti-Psi: (Anti-Talents) (Prudence Organizations)
Inertial: Nullify a telepath
Anti-precog: “The precog sees a variety of futures, laid out side by side like cells in a beehive. For him one has greater luminosity, and this he picks. Once he has picked it the anti-precog can do nothing; the anti-precog has to be present when the precog is in the process of deciding”
Girl Pat: (Anti-Precog) can control the future, the one luminous possibility is luminous because she has gone into the past and changed it and by changing it, she changes the preset. Could be a talent rather than an anti talent


###1
* Melipone is of the map at the Runciter organization (a prudence organization)
* They inform Runciter and he decides to go see his wife at the Moratorium in Switzerland
* He meets Mr Herbert the owner of the place and they place him in a private office to talk to Ella
* Herbert remembers some old events, they hired the anti-psi, Runciter’s company to get rid of a telepath which installed itself at the Moratorium. Runciter was able to get rid of it and also do a monthly check up. Herbert wonders if the anti-psi prudence organization is just claiming a need for their services when no one actually need it

###2
* Runciter He although his wife is dead, he had always relied on her wisdom, the female wisdom based not on knowledge or experience or something innate
* Runciter is worried that they are starting to have more inactive interials with nothing to do because there aren’t many Psis to nullify. Many Psis are missing and so the request for anti-psis is dropping
* Ella didn’t recognize who Dole Melipone was. Melipone can generate twice the psi field of any other Hollis employee
* Ella describes Death to her husband. Gravity begins not to affect you and slowly you start floating until you’re out of the system
* Runciter loses the communication with his wife due to her neighbor having a better signal than her. Runciter gets upsets and demands a solution
* Mr Herbert is unable to tell Mr Runciter’s age since a lot of medical procedures might’ve happened. We know that he is 4 times the age of Ella, 20 so he is 80

###3
* Joe Chip’s apartment. G G Ashwood comes and asks Joe to test a new talent. Joe is behind on rent and cleaning services and doesn’t even have a coin to open the door
* Eventually G G Ashwood enters the apartment with the girl, 17 year old and beautiful
* Joe asks G G to leave so that he is able to test. Apparently she has a unique anti-psi talent where she can change the past without time-travel. She can think of an event and alter the history of that event
* We also learn that a precog can see a list of futures with one being luminous. Anti talent can make it hard to see the right future but she has a crazy power where can she alter the future without the precog knowing what is happening
* Joe writes in his assessment she is dangerous and needs to be watched but tells her that is he is recommending her to be hired

###4
* Glen Runciter is back and asks his assistant to run a TV ad every hour instead of 3 because that was the main advice Ella gave him
* Ms Wirt a new client meets Runciter and asks for a fast service for her company/client. Runciter wants to know who she works for but she doesn’t say so he asks Nina to listen to her thoughts
* Nina tells him that the project is under Stanton Mick on his research facility on Luna. They are working on a radical low-cost interstellar drive system
* Joe and Pat show up and meet with Glen. He looks at her score sheet and offers her a job
* Ms Wirt informs Glen that her employer wants to sign the contract immediately. They want 11 interials not 40

###5
* Two brothers Matt from Hollis (telepath) and Bill (precog) talking to Tippy Jackson (anti-telepath). Glen calls Tippy and asks her to join Joe’s mission
* Ms Wirt signs a check for G G Ashwood. GG is upset in Glen’s office. They talk about Pat. Glen thinks that Pat is more like a talent than an anti-talent
* The group formed in Glen’s office 5 females, 5 males and Pat. 4 of which are anti-precogs. He went on to ask Pat to describe her anti-talent but he suddenly found himself on Fifth Avenue and then back again in his office with Joe and Pat introducing herself for the first time. Joe knows she must’ve done something and changed the past. He also realized that he is married to Pat and that Mick took his business to another firm! agh
* They realize what she did and she reverts it. Now Glen is back in his office meeting the new team
* Glen talks to each member, Francesca Spanish (the one who detected that they were transformed by Pat), Tito Apostos, Don Denny (anti-animator), Sammy Mundo (anti-telepath), Wendy Wright (the one Joe likes), Fred Zasky (anti-parakineticist) and more … 
* Before they fly out, Apostos tells Joe about that he contact one of Hollis’ people working with their precogs but Joe dismisses it

###6
* At Luna, Zoe Wirt shows them their place, a 9 bedroom with many amenities. Joe starts measuring their psi-field and Zoe tells him that Mr. Mick doesn’t allow it and she calls him but Joe takes the measurement anyway
* They discover that there aren’t any psi-field other and they ask Mick about it. Things gets suspicious and Mick starts floating up to the ceiling at which point Runciter knows it’s a humanoid bomb. He tells everyone to leave right now but it was too late and the thing explodes
* Runciter is still breathing at the ground. Everyone else is kind of injured. Joe assumes leadership
* They hurry out to the ship but they don’t understand why isn’t Hollis coming after them right away. They also ask Pat to change history but she laughs and says it’s too late. They reach the ship and put Runciter in a cold-pac and leave. As they leave they see more thing explode

###7
* It takes them a while to get in contact with Switzerland because the phonebook was 2 years old!! although the ship wasn’t built then!! Joe’s cigarettes are also too old!!
* They arrive in Switzerland. Joe gets a cup of coffee but it’s so old with mold on it, even the cream is sour. He gets upset and Al Hammond tries to calms him down. He urges him to go to the chopper and take Runciter to the moratorium
* They arrive at the moratorium. Joe wants to examine the whole process of reviving Runciter but Herbert insists that Joe and Al go to the lounge (hmm??)
* Joe asks Al for a coin so he can rent a precog to see what’s in the future and right when he wanted to use the coin it turned out to be old and not accepted anymore
* Joe exchanges the coin and calls Hollis International. They recognize him and immediately transfer him to Mr Hollis. Joe threatens Mr Hollis that he is going to report them to the society. He gets a bad feeling and imagines snakes? and hangs up
* Al urges him to go to a hotel and sleep and have rest. He said he will send him Wendy while they all go back to New York

###8
* Joe wakes up in the massive room, he picks up the phone for room service but he hears a voice telling him that they need to prove first that Mr Mick was involved in the explosion before they report him. He hangs up but then realizes that the voice was actually Runciter’s voice!!!!
* He hears a knock on the door, it was Herbert. He tells him Al told him where he was and that he should come with him to tell Ella the news. He said they tried to revive Runciter but they weren’t able to. Herbert tried to listen to the voice on the phone but could’t (hmmm?)

* Joe gets suspicious. Is that message really from Al? Herbert asks about the girl and Joe tells him that no one shows up although he expected Wendy
* Herbert tells Joe to check the closet! (did he know????) and yes a ruined body was there and it was Wendy. Joe wishes that she didn’t suffer
* Joe thinks it might be radiation from the explosion and they will all die soon but wait what about the phonebook, cigarettes, coffee and the coin?
* In New York, Al with the other interials are expecting Joe to show up anytime soon. They think of the list they have so far (old cigarettes, old phone book, old coffee and then the match folder?)
* The match folder looked odd on the list and then when they retrieved it , an Ad that mentioned the death of Runciter was on it. It was a mystery because they had the match folders since before the trip to Luna
* Another mystery all their money had Runciter’s head on them instead of Disney or Castro? What is going on?
* Joe comes back and tells Al what happened. They decide to leave to a random city and try the Runciter money and also maybe buy cigarettes and see if they get old 

###9
* Joe and Al go to Baltimore to test the money. The money is accepted and the cigarettes were old. They also look at more packs and one of the packs had an actually message for them Runciter! 
* They buy a tape recorder and take it to a shop and the guy tells them that this model is so old no one sells it anymore. They realize later that maybe only them are regressing and not everyone else around
* “I missed a detail here when they decide to go Des Moise to find Runciter”
* They take the elevator back but during the ride Al realizes that he is regressing at a far greater speed than Joe because Joe couldn’t see that the elevator is so old from 1910
* Al realizes that he is definitely dying and maybe that is how Wendy went. They go back and he goes to the men’s restroom. Joe goes with them and they see a graffiti from Runciter on the wall " LEAN OVER THE BOWL AND THEN TAKE A DIVE. ALL OF YOU ARE DEAD. I AM ALIVE”
* Now they realize that maybe they’re all dead and not yet have reached the half-live status and Runciter is actually trying to reach them. Scary!
* Joe goes back to the conference room while Al is dying? In the restroom on his own Al tells him to stick with them because this is how you die if you leave and not stick to the group. He doesn’t find them. A TV ad was running with another message from Runciter about them being dead

###10
* News cast was on and the news of the death of Runciter was on TV and how everyone is there in Des Moines for his funeral except for Wendy, Al and Joe. This is confusing because now it seems that Runciter actually died?
* Another commercial with Runciter’s voice for Ubik which stops or reverse the process of regression that everyone is going through
* Runciter however begins speaking to Joe about how he knew about the explosion ahead of time and that he is really dead and should go to Des Moines so that he can calm down. He also said that her recorded this commercial ahead of time. Now this is really confusing, is he head or not?
* He decided to go back to his building and then go to Des Moines. Everything is old in his apartment, appliances are replaced with earlier versions and others just disappeared except for the door asking for money!
* He goes to the mailbox to get the Ubik because the commercial said they’ll send him a sample but what he gets is an old version of it since it too regressed (irony!) 
* He finds an old car from 1939 parked and he drives it to the airfield to try to catch a plane to Des Moines but by the time he was able to negotiate a deal, the car too regressed to 1929 model
* He is desperate now  and even the Ubik he has also regressed further and he is thinking of drinking it to die. He though finds a new message on it “Don’t do it, Joe. There’s another way. Keep trying. You’ll find it. Lots of luck”

###11
* The plane guys knocks on Joe’s door and asks about the Ubik bottle. It is apparently very rare and agrees to take Joe to Des Moines if he can take it. They fly right away and arrive the next day at 3pm
* Mr Bliss drives him to the service. It is September 13th 1939
* He finally reunites with Edie Dorn, Tippy Jackson, Jon Ild, Francy Spanish, Tito Apostos, Don Denny, Sammy Mundo, Fred Zafsky and Pat
* They ask if he is seeing old things like what they’re seeing and he says that life indeed regressed around them 53 years. He asks if they saw Runciter anywhere and it doesn’t seem that they did
* Francesca though dream of Ubik coming from the sky in the hands of God. Joe tells them about Runciter coming through the TV commercial but they don’t seem convinced
* Joe goes to see Runciter in the casket but he shuts it?
* Joe comes back and tell them that they might have been all killed in the blast according to Runciter. Pat doesn’t think that it makes sense. Joe says that nothing so far made sense, the commercial, the note in the cigarette pack, the tape recorder etc 
* It seems that Eddie is missing now, she went back to the hotel and Joe tells them that to save her they got to go to the hotel 

###12
* On the way back, they ask Pat how come she never helped with anything. Pat tells them that she lost her talent ever since they landed on Luna
* A cop stops them and Joe gets a ticket, he instructs them to go to the hotel anyway. Joe reads the message on the ticket and it says "You are in much greater danger than I thought. What Pat Conley said is” and at the bottom it said to go to a drug store caller Archer
* The building that had the drug store was changing in Joe’s eyes between a modern art store from 1992 and the old drug store? Anyway he went in and asked to buy Ubik but it was for 40 dollars and he couldn’t afford. He though found another message that warns him about Pat. "absolutely untrue. She did not—repeat, not—try to use her talent following the bomb blast. She did not try to restore Wendy Wright or Al Hammond or Edie Dorn. She’s lying to you, Joe, and that makes me rethink the whole situation. I’ll let you know as soon as I come to a conclusion. Meanwhile be very careful. By the way: Ubik powder is of universal healing value if directions for use are rigorously and conscientiously followed”
* He goes to the hotel and shows Denny the citation. Apparently Eddie is gone and Fred is gone too. They both get scared. It is much worse that what they thought
* They confront Pat and Joe asks if G G Ashwood works for Hollis and sent her to them. She smiled and the hotel lobby exploded!!!!!!!! scary

###13
* Joe looked bad afterwards, he is tired and exhausted. He wants to go upstairs to a room. Denny gets him a room and asks Pat to help him go upstairs.
* He goes to the elevator with her help but he sees the 1909 elevator Al saw when he was dying so he changes his mind and decides to take the stairs
* The steps are extremely painful and he is exhausted. Pat finally declares that yes she worked with G G Ashwood and they are really good friends or maybe even had an affair. She is happy to see him dying finally and she laughed because Wendy died while he was in the same room sleeping
* Finally as he reached the second floor she tells him that she is going to tell Denny that he left to go the hospital. He agrees
* In the hotel room he sees Runciter!!!!! Runciter locks the door and gives him Ubik to revive him!!!!

14
* Joe is back and he is asking Runciter all kinds of questions. Runciter tells him that they are all dead and he is alive. He tells him they are all in the moratorium and that he is trying hard to reach everyone of them
* He tells him that Pat is doing all of this and that her limit was 1939 that Mick used the bomb against them. Joe isn’t convinced why use Pat then? why do they need her if they are all dead because of the explosion why the need to regress time and so on
* Runciter tries to convince that Pat is evil, how she killed Wendy and waited to watch him take the stairs? Although Runciter said earlier that he was waiting in the room, how did he know?
* Joe also asks if the decay they’re going through is normal or as a result of Pat? Runciter says that it is normal, Ella is going through the same? This is more confusing now …
* Plus Runciter was the casket!!!?
* Joe finally declares that Runciter doesn’t know either what is going on, who’s the enemy and who’s trying to help them out here … 
* Glen stops the communication and decided to talk to Niggelman later about filing the criminal report to the Society
* He decides that he wants to talk to Ella before he goes to sleep, He doesn’t want Jory to take over though like last time. Jory is something!

###15
* The doctor comes with Denny to examine Joe. Joe is fine though and insists that Denny uses Ubik to spray himself. Once he does Denny evaporates and Jory appears! yikes
* Jory tells him that he ate everyone to keep himself alive including Pat. He made up all of this world. 1939 because it is easier to make with the decay going on
* Joe tries to kills him but he wasn’t able to. Jory can’t eat Joe either because of Ubik. Joe leaves the hotel

###16
* Joe takes a cab around town to test Jory’s theory before realizing it was useless and will only increase Jory’s appetite
* He sees a lady walking by and stops to talk to her. He wants to take her to dinner
* She rides in the car and gives him a message. Apparently he is entitled for a life time supply of Ubik. The girl turns out to be Ella. She isn’t doing him a selfless favor. She hates Jory and also she is going to be reborn soon and wants him to help Runciter with the business
* He takes the certificate to the drug store but in there the pharmacist says they don’t have it anymore, he realizes the pharmacist is actually just Jory and run to the shelves to get the Ubik but also realizes Ubik here regressed and Jory tells him that he won’t find it anymore
* He tries to focus his mind on Ubik to bring 1992 back. Later on when he’s outside on a bench a girl comes in and tells him she is from the factory and gives him a spray can. His message to bring 1992 actually worked and now he has a can. There is a message on the can with the name with the name of the girl

###17
* Runciter is waiting to talk to Ella. The worker gives him several 50 cent coins with Joe Chip’s picture on them … The book ends with “This is just the beginning”
